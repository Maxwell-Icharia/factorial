# factorial

It gets the factorial of n numbers

That is, if n is equal to 6, the function would return;


	6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 which is 720.

Necessary tests have been defined in tests/ directory and can be run using nosetests


It is a function made using python 2.7 but that will not hinder performance
